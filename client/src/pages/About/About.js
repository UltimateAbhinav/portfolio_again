                    I am a final-year undergraduate student at NSUT, passionate about technology and software development. As a self-taught MERN stack developer, I have honed my skills through various personal projects and coursework, although I haven't yet had the opportunity to gain industry experience. I am now actively seeking job opportunities in Software Development Engineering (SDE) to apply my knowledge in a professional setting and contribute to innovative projects. My goal is to leverage my technical skills and enthusiasm for learning to grow within a dynamic and forward-thinking company.
